File handling in Java is an essential utility that allows developers to create, read, write, update, and delete files. It is a fundamental aspect of software development used for data persistence, configuration management, and logging purposes. Java provides multiple classes for file handling, primarily through the java.io and java.nio packages. These packages include classes like File, FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, PrintWriter, and RandomAccessFile. File handling is important for managing structured and unstructured data in various applications, such as databases, text processing, and configuration files. Java offers both character-based and byte-based file handling methods, ensuring compatibility with different types of data, including plain text and binary files. Character-based handling is done using classes like FileReader and FileWriter, while byte-based handling is managed with FileInputStream and FileOutputStream. Buffered streams (BufferedReader and BufferedWriter) enhance performance by reducing direct disk access.
